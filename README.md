Copyright 2018-2019 Yiping Liu 

This are the codes of the imbalance distance minimization problems (IDMP) and the evolutionary algorithm using a convergence-penalized density method (CPDEA) proposed in "Yiping Liu, Hisao Ishibuchi, Gary G. Yen, Yusuke Nojima, and Naoki Masuyama, Handling Imbalance Between Convergence and Diversity in the Decision Space in Evolutionary Multi-Modal Multi-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 2019, Early Access, [DOI: 10.1109/TEVC.2019.2938557](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2019.2938557)". 

The codes use [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO) [(v1.6)](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO/releases/tag/PlatEMO_v1.6.1) published in "Ye Tian, Ran Cheng, Xingyi Zhang, and Yaochu Jin, PlatEMO: A MATLAB Platform for Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 2017, 12(4): 73-87". 

Please drop IDMP and CPDEA into .\Algorithms and .\Problems, respectively. Then Enjoy.
